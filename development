1. Build basic PLEXOS validation model with scenarios:
    a. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, PHES
    b. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES
    c. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES, batteries
    d. Capacity expansion

2. Build FIRM_CE single_time model and validate against scenarios a - c (Only have PHES power as decision variable, restrict at 48h size)

3. Build FIRM_CE capacity_expansion model and validate against d

4. Modify ISP model and run following scenarios:
    a. Sampled chronology
    b. DLT chronology
    c. Change in PHES costs
    d. PHES larger than 48h

5. Build ISP model in FIRM_CE

6. Results:
    a. Gas required in 2050 (and associated emissions budget)
    b. Effect of change in PHES costs
    c. Behaviour of batteries + PHES in hybrid systems

PLEXOS bugs
- Add transmission line costs
- Make into mock single-time instead of capacity expansion
