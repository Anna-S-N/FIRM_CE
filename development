1. Build basic PLEXOS validation model with scenarios:
    a. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, PHES x
    b. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES x
    c. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES, batteries x
    d. Capacity expansion

2. Build FIRM_CE single_time model and validate against scenarios a - c (Only have PHES power as decision variable, restrict at 48h size)

3. Build FIRM_CE capacity_expansion model and validate against d

4. Modify ISP model and run following scenarios:
    a. Sampled chronology
    b. DLT chronology
    c. Change in PHES costs
    d. PHES larger than 48h

5. Build ISP model in FIRM_CE

6. Results:
    a. Gas required in 2050 (and associated emissions budget)
    b. Effect of change in PHES costs
    c. Behaviour of batteries + PHES in hybrid systems

PLEXOS bugs
- Add transmission line costs

FIRM_CE bugs
- Add fuel costs into calculation
- MOVE FLEXIBLE GENERATION INTO FREQUENCY ANALYSIS, WITH CHARGING CAPACITY OF 0
- Different scenarios may have different numbers of decision variables for initial_guess.csv
- CUTOFF FREQUENCIES MUST BE AN ORDERED LIST. USE PENALTY FUNCTION TO QUICKLY FORCE THIS AT THE START OF OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
- Might need power capacity constraints when adding flexible back in again?
