1. Build basic PLEXOS validation model with scenarios:
    a. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, PHES x
    b. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES x
    c. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES, batteries x
    d. Capacity expansion

2. Build FIRM_CE single_time model and validate against scenarios a - c (Only have PHES power as decision variable, restrict at 48h size)

3. Build FIRM_CE capacity_expansion model and validate against d

4. Modify ISP model and run following scenarios:
    a. Sampled chronology
    b. DLT chronology
    c. Change in PHES costs
    d. PHES larger than 48h

5. Build ISP model in FIRM_CE

6. Results:
    a. Gas required in 2050 (and associated emissions budget)
    b. Effect of change in PHES costs
    c. Behaviour of batteries + PHES in hybrid systems

PLEXOS CHANGES
- Remove maintenance (forced outage rate, outage factor, mean time to repair)
- Remove MLF
- Remove Aux Incr? Rating Factor? Rating? Heat Rate Base / Incr? Efficiency Incr?
- Remove Mark-up, Max Capacity Factor, Min Capacity Factor?
- Remove Firm Capacity?
- Remove REZ augmentation and Group REZ augmentation?
- Remove Liquid fuel, biomass, coal and H2?
- Only keep OCGT Large and remove other gas?
- Single time optimisation instead of capacity expansion
- Separate new build solar and wind, or keep as REZ?
- Remove Load Subtractors? What are they? Small-scale??
- Remove Max Cycles Day, Min/Max SOC
- Add initial SOC of 50% to all batteries
- Convert hydro/PHES storages to batteries and remove the waterways + storages
- Remove summer/winter ratings on transmission - Make Max/Min flow the same magnitude
- Remove Line Min/Max Capacity Reserves?
- Marinus Loss Coefficients?
- Remove policy constraints?
- Remove REZ limits? Or at least just roll them into Build limits?
- Remove landholder payments?
- Remove Min Capacity Reserves from Zones
- Remove DSP Bid Price, DSP Bid Quantity, Generator Settlement Model, Load Includes Losses, Load Metering Point, Load Settlement Model, VoLL
- Remove from lines Min Capacity Reserves, Max Capacity Reserves, Marginal Loss Factor, Marginal Loss Factor Back, Loss Allocation etc., 

FIRM_CE bugs
- Existing capacity: FOM and VOM and Fuel, not LCOE - why are hydro costs so high compared to gas?
- Can flexible gen be dispatched one at a time, so that cheapest is prioritised?
- Statistics breaks if empty baseload or etc.
