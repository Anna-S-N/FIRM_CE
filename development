1. Build basic PLEXOS validation model with scenarios:
    a. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, PHES x
    b. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES x
    c. Solar, wind, hydro, coal, gas, PHES, batteries x
    d. Capacity expansion

2. Build FIRM_CE single_time model and validate against scenarios a - c (Only have PHES power as decision variable, restrict at 48h size)

3. Build FIRM_CE capacity_expansion model and validate against d

4. Modify ISP model and run following scenarios:
    a. Sampled chronology
    b. DLT chronology
    c. Change in PHES costs
    d. PHES larger than 48h

5. Build ISP model in FIRM_CE

6. Results:
    a. Gas required in 2050 (and associated emissions budget)
    b. Effect of change in PHES costs
    c. Behaviour of batteries + PHES in hybrid systems

PLEXOS bugs
- Add transmission line costs

FIRM_CE bugs
- Add fuel costs into calculation
- Different scenarios may have different numbers of decision variables for initial_guess.csv
- Energy constraints on flexible?
- Precharging storage when checking constraints? Charge from spillage at other nodes??
- Balancing power sum equals zero?
- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsr.2010.06.018
- Test model that forces batteries to always be fully charged

- Existing capacity: FOM and VOM and Fuel, not LCOE

- Some bug whenever SPowert_update is negative driving large deficits - Storage should not be charging when there is a deficit
