    Provides a complete description of the system associated with a candidate solution vector. The system can be
    evaluated according to the unit committment business rules.

    Notes:
    -------
    - The candidate solution vector 'x' defines the new-build capacities for Generator, Storage, and major Line
    objects in the system.
    - The Solution.static instance is unsafe to modify within the Solution class.
    - The Solution.fleet and Solution.network attributes are dynamic copies of the instances used to initialise
    an instance of this class. Most attributes of dynamic jitclass instances are safe to modify within an
    optimisation. Refer to the class definitions for specific jitclasses for information on which attributes
    remain unsafe to modify.
    - Reliability and fixed-cost constraints may terminate evaluation early, accumulating penalties scaled by
    PENALTY_MULTIPLIER. If the fixed cost threshold is set too low, it is very likely that the optimisation will
    get stuck in a local minimum (fixed costs just below threshold, reliability constraint still breached). This
    issue can be mitigated by increasing the mutation factor, raising the fixed cost threshold, or increasing the build
    limit of flexible Generator capacity.
    - The energy (cost) returned by the objective function is a system-level levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). This
    is calculated to be the sum of variable and fixed costs of all assets in the system divided by total operational
    demand over the modelling horizon, units $/MWh.

    Attributes:
    -------
    x (float64[:]): Candidate solution decision variable vector.
    evaluated (boolean): Flag indicating whether `objective()` has been evaluated.
    lcoe (float64): Levelised cost of electricity for the candidate, units $/MWh.
    penalties (float64): Accumulated penalties for soft-constraint violations (fixed-costs and reliability), units $ or GW.
    balancing_type (unicode_type): Balancing mode (e.g., 'full' for balancing with the complete time-series over the entire
        time horizon at the specified resolution).
    fixed_costs_threshold (float64): Upper bound on fixed costs intensity, units $/MWh of operational demand. Allows
        low-quality solutions to be rapidly discarded and penalised without evaluating the time-consuming unit committment
        problem.
    static (ScenarioParameters_InstanceType): Static scenario parameters (unsafe to modify).
    fleet (Fleet_InstanceType): Dynamic copy of Fleet instance for this evaluation (safe to modify some attributes).
    network (Network_InstanceType): Dynamic copy of Network instance for this evaluation (safe to modify some attributes).
