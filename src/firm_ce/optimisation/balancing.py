    Iterate backwards through the time intervals in the precharging period, adjusting the dispatch power of
    Storage systems and flexible Generators to transfer enough energy to Storage precharges to balance the
    deficit block.

    Notes:
    -------
    - Storage systems and flexible Generators that transfer energy into other Storage systems are called
    trickle-chargers.
    - Storage systems that receive transfered energy are called prechargers.
    - Dispatch powers that were originally determined during forward-time balancing are adjusted in the
    precharging period, rather than recalculated from scratch. This is different to the behaviour during
    the deficit block balancing, even though both periods iterate backwards through time.
    - Stored energy (Storage) and remaining energy (Generator) are not updated in the precharging period.
    This is because a discontinuity will exist between the original forward-time balancing and the adjustment
    resulting from the reverse-time balancing actions. The energy value discontinuity is instead resolved in
    a subsequent step.

    Parameters:
    -------
    interval (int64): Index of the first interval of the deficit block.
    solution (Solution_InstanceType): An instance of the Solution jitclass providing a complete description

def precharge_storage(solution, interval_after_deficit_block: int64, year: int64) -> None:
    """
    Core unit committment business rules for precharging Storage systems. The high-level process is:

        1. Iterate backwards through a period of intervals that have power deficits (i.e., deficit block)
        and dispatch assets using reverse-time symmetry rules. That is, discharging adds energy to the previous
        time interval and charging removes energy. Determine the amount of energy required to be transfered into
        Storage prechargers such that they can complete the deficit block balancing.
        2. Upon reaching the start of the deficit block, iterate backwards through the precharging period adjusting
        the dispatch power of Storage systems and flexible Generators to transfer sufficient energy from
        trickle-chargers to prechargers.
        3. Once precharging is completed, iterate back forwards through time from the start of the precharging period
        checking that the stored energy and remaining energy constraints contiguous with the period immediately prior
        to precharging will not be violated. Adjust dispatch decisions to maintain feasibility.

    Parameters:
    -------
    solution (Solution_InstanceType): An instance of the Solution jitclass providing a complete description
        of the system for this candidate solution.
    interval_after_deficit_block (int64): First interval after the deficit block.
    year (int64): Year index for the time interval immediately after the deficit block.

    Returns:
    -------
    None.

    Side-effects:
    -------
    Substantial modification of dynamic and precharging attributes in the Fleet and Network jitclasses. Refer to the
    docstrings of the functions called below for details.
