    """
    A 'static' instance of the Route jitclass (Route.static_instance=True) is copied
    and marked as a 'dynamic' instance (Route.static_instance=False).

    Static instances are created during Model initialisation and supplied as arguments
    to the differential evolution. These arguments are references to the original jitclass instances (not copies).
    Candidate solutions within the differential evolution are tested in embarrasingly parrallel,
    making it unsafe for multiple workers to similtaneously modify the same memory referenced
    across each process.

    Instead, each worker must create a deep copy of the referenced instance that is safe to modify
    within that worker process. Not all attributes within a dynamic instance are safe to modify.
    Only attributes that are required to be modified when testing the candidate solution are
    copied in order to save memory. If an attribute is unsafe to modify after copying, it will
    be marked with a comment that says "This remains static" in the create_dynamic_copy fast_method for
    that jitclass.

    Parameters:
    -------
    route_instance (Route_InstanceType): A static instance of the Route jitclass.
    nodes_typed_dict (DictType(int64, Node_InstanceType)): A typed dictionary of
        all Node jitclass instances for the scenario. Key defined as Node.order.
    lines_typed_dict (DictType(int64, Line_InstanceType)): A typed dictionary of
        all Line jitclass instances for the scenario. Key defined as Line.order.

    During a transmission action, the flow update of each Route for a given fill node and route length
    is initially based upon the surplus energy at the final Node in the route. It is constrained by
    the maximum flow update possible for that Route. A temporary surplus value, rather than the total
    surplus, is used to account for surplus energy that has already been committed to Routes for the
    same fill node and route length. The temporary surplus value prevents double-counting of surplus
    energy.

    Note that each Line in a Route has a direction that is defined by the order of the start and end Nodes of
    that Line. Increasing flow in one direction is equivalent to decreasing flow in the opposite direction.
