"""
An example is provided for building a FIRM Model instance and then solving it. The Model object is built using the default `inputs/config` and
`inputs/data` files. Each scenario in `inputs/config/scenarios.csv` is optimised sequentially using the SciPy differential evolution algorithm.
Results are saved in the `results` folder.

Alternative filepaths for the config and data folders can be provided as arguments to the Model instantiation.
